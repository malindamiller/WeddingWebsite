      <h1 class = "blueHeader">Our Story<h1>
      <p id = "storyFont">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Austin and Malinda first met freshman year. They were in the same freshman computer science course and they both lived in Senat Hall.
      Austin approached Malinda at a dance the first weekened of school, and introduced himself.  They became good friends.
      Malinda remembers Austin conforting her when she was upset, and thought "he would make a good boyfriend someday". As sophmore year started they both started having feelings
      for each other but they didn't know it. The week before christmas break, they spent a lot of time together, studying for finals. Austin was going to Cleveland for a co-op in the
      spring and would not be at school for the entire semester.  Malinda planned to leave to go home for christmas break and friday afternoon, but ended up having to stay because of car
      problems.  Since their entire friend group had already went home, Austin asked Malinda to dinner and then while at dinner he asked her to go ice skating (which they didn't get
      to do in NYC). They had a great time but both of them were afraid to call it a date.</p>

      <p id = "storyFont">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over Christmas break, they texted often. Austin messaged Malinda and recalled how great of a time he had hanging out with her. Malinda agreed.
      Austin asked Malinda if she would like to do it again sometime and when Malinda said yes, he said "just the the two of us?" Malinda replied with "it's a date." Austin came
      to visit her at school by suprising her. It was snowing really hard, and he had said he couldn't make it because of the road conditions. They went skiing and Austin spilled hot chocolate
      all over Malinda. When they got back, they watched Forest Gump and Austin used tickling her as an excuse to put his arm around her. After the movie they kissed.</p>

      <p id = "storyFont">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After two and a half years of dating Austin and Malinda took a trip to California to celebrate their graduation from Penn State. They went to Yosemite
      National Park to stay for a few days.  On the first day there, they hiked to the top of Sentinel Dome. It was the most beautiful place, either of them had every seen.  At 9000 feet
      above sea level, overlooking the entire park and Yosemite falls, Austin proposed.  He had the ring custom made, and had carried it around in his pocket all day, waiting for the most perfect spot.
      Malinda just cried at first out of pure happiness so he asked her again and then she said yes!  Because of a lack of cell phone service and the time difference, we couldn't even tell out families for three days.
      We are excited to spend our lives together!</p>
